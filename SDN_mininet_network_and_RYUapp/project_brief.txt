This project is based upon SDN open Flow protocol where I used Mininet to create Wired and Wireless Network Architecture and used RYU Manager to run Routing and Switching application. 
File flyingnetsv4.py contains wired network architecture which can be run using SDN-vm having Mininet installed 
File wireless.py contains wireless network architecture which can be run using Mininet-WiFi. 
The rs_appv4.py is the Routing and switching application which installs flow rules dynamically on the switches. 
All of the coding has been done using Python.
